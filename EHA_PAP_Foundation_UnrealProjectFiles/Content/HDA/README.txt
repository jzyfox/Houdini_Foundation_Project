- The Unreal project has loaded the .hdalc files (Houdini Indie Files).

	You'll need to have a Houdini Engine Indie license installed.
	Which you can get for free from the sidefx.com website.

- I have also included the .hda files (Houdini Commercial Files) in this folder.

	In case you only have a commercial Houdini Engine License.
